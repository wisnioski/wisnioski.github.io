	<h1>Dr. Emily Wisnioski</h1>
	<p>I am currently an <a href="https://astro3d.org.au/">ASTRO-3D Fellow</a> hosted at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. 
		I study the life-cycle of galaxies at the peak epoch of mass formation. A focus of my research is to make evolutionary connections across cosmic time.</p>
